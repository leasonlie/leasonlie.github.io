profile:
  - description: I am a Master student at the School of Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My research interests are mainly concentrated on <b>Prognostic and Health Management (PHM), surface modification treatment, and adaptive machining technology</b>. I have been working for the Fraunhofer project center for smart manufacturing at SJTU. The focuses of my research were towards the influence of Dengeling on the surface integrity and fatigue strength of titanium alloys, the application of the spindle power data in tool condition monitoring (TCM) based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), and the application of Mixed Reality(MR) in the industrial scenario.
